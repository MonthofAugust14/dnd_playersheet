# Dungeon & Dragons PlayerSheet
This is my first programming project, a Dungions and Dragons playersheet program written in python using the tkinter library.

This program contains a tab for the character playersheet and spellsheet. 
The goal was to turn a traditional Dungeons and Dragons playersheet into a digital program that can be altered and saved for continuous use.

Additional features have been added, such as buttons to automatically roll Initiative, Attack, and Ability Scores.

While design wise the program is bare, it's main purpose was programming practice. 

Enjoy!
